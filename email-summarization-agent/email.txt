Subject: Project Timeline Update
 
Hi team,
 
We reviewed the Q1 project timeline and there are a few updates.
 
The client has requested that the initial prototype be delivered by March 10 instead of March 20.
This means design needs to finalize assets by March 5 at the latest.
 
Engineering should prioritize API integration this week.
We’ll review progress in Friday’s sync.
 
Let me know if there are concerns.
 
Thanks,
SuryaNesanuru
